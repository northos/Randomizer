This is a simple script to pick a random item out of a .txt file.
In order for it to work properly, each item should be its own line in the file.
There is no need to distinguish the lines other than that.

Program input is straightforward. It will ask for the name of a file; type it in with no special formatting, quotes, or punctiation.
It will output one of the lines from the file, chosen at random.
You can also input an integer (again, unformatted); in this case, it will output an integer between 1 and what you entered (inclusive).

Some .txt files are included in the repo; these are just examples of files that I've used myself.
